# 🧠 Getting Started with Flutter & Dart – Module 6: Stateful vs Stateless Widgets

This README documents my hands-on learning journey through **Module 6** of Coursera’s _“Getting Started with Flutter & Dart”_ course by **Packt**.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

This module focused on mastering Flutter widgets, widget composition, and understanding how state management works via `StatelessWidget` vs `StatefulWidget`. Through a guided build of a **Tip Calculator App**, I explored layout design, widget reuse, theme control, and reactive UI with `setState`.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets.
- Implement dynamic UI using `setState`.
- Apply theming and widget composition.
- Build and refactor widgets using best practices in Dart.
- Explore real-world design with sliders, counters, and text fields.

## 🧠 Sample Q&A from Coursera Coach Dialogue

> **Q: What is state in Flutter?**  
> A: It's the data that determines how a widget looks/behaves. StatefulWidgets can change state dynamically, StatelessWidgets cannot.

> **Q: Why can't state be const?**  
> A: Because it must be mutable — it needs to change when user interactions occur.

> **Q: Why is `setState()` important?**  
> A: It notifies Flutter that state has changed and triggers the UI to rebuild.

> **Q: When would a StatelessWidget fail?**  
> A: In dynamic apps like a counter — it can’t track changes or update UI without setState in a StatefulWidget.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Flutter SDK
- Dart
- VS Code
- Coursera Interactive Learning + Coach AI

## 🏁 Conclusion

This module laid the foundation for reactive app development in Flutter by clearly distinguishing between static and dynamic widgets. The project-based approach and Coach conversations made abstract concepts practically applicable.
