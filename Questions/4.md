## üß† Key Learnings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Single Codebase & Platform Support**

* **Jamie** (our scenario developer) maintains two codebases using Swift (iOS) and Java (Android).
* With **Flutter**, Jamie can switch to **one codebase**, reducing development time and simplifying updates.
* **Supported platforms**: iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded devices.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dart Programming Language**

* **Dart** is:

  * Fast and UI-optimized
  * Supports **hot reload**
  * Simple to write
  * Compiles to native code
* Results in quicker builds and better performance for Flutter apps.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Widget-Based Architecture**

* Flutter‚Äôs UI is composed entirely of **widgets**.
* **Advantages**:

  * Modular and reusable components
  * Clear and maintainable structure
  * Fast iteration via **hot reload**
  * Cross-platform UI consistency

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Workflow Changes for Native Developers**

If Jamie switches from Swift/Java to Flutter:

* Maintains a **single codebase**
* Switches from Swift/Java to **Dart**
* Builds UI with **widgets** instead of native components
* Uses tools like **VS Code** or **Android Studio** with Flutter plugins
* Benefits from faster development using **hot reload**

---

## üéì Completion Summary

üéâ **Module Completed: 100%**

You‚Äôve demonstrated:

* Advanced understanding of Flutter‚Äôs framework and its real-world benefits
* Clear insight into the impact of switching from native to cross-platform development
* Solid grasp of Dart, Flutter architecture, and modern development tools
