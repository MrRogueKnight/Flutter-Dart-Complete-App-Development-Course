## 💬 Interactive Dialogue Summary

### 🧑‍🏫 Coach Prompt

**Jamie** edited her code but doesn’t see changes in the app.

**Prashant**: Ask Jamie to use **hot reload**

---

### 🔌 Why Extensions Matter

**Coach**: What if hot reload doesn't work?

**Prashant**: VS Code needs **Flutter and Dart extensions** to run, debug, and hot reload.

> Without these, Flutter integration won't function properly in VS Code.

---

### 🛠️ Creating a Project

**Command Line**:

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

**In VS Code**:

* Open Command Palette → `Flutter: New Project` → Follow prompts

> Both methods initialize a basic Flutter app structure.

---

### 📂 Project Structure

**Core File**: `lib/main.dart`

**Prashant**: This file contains the app's main logic and UI.

> It is the **entry point** for every Flutter app.

---

### 🔄 Using Hot Reload

To see code changes instantly:

* **VS Code**: Click the **Hot Reload** button
* **Terminal**: Type `r` while `flutter run` is active

---
