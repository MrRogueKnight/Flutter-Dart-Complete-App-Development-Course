## 🧑‍💻 Dialogue Summary

### 👨‍🏫 Coach

Let’s begin your Flutter setup journey on Windows!

### Installing Git for Windows

**Status**: Complete

> No specific issues discussed, but Git is essential for managing Flutter projects and dependencies.

---

### Installing Android Studio and the Flutter SDK

**Scenario**:

> David only installed Android Studio’s command-line tools, skipping the emulator and AVD Manager.

**Issues Identified**:

* No virtual device → Flutter has no place to run the app.
* Unaccepted licenses → Build fails.
* Missing build tools → Incomplete SDK.
* Broken toolchain → Compile issues.
* Unset SDK path → Flutter can’t detect Android SDK.

**Conclusion**:

> David needs a **full Android Studio install**, including the emulator, build tools, and SDK platforms.

### Setting Up System PATH

**Why it matters**:

* Lets Windows run `flutter`, `dart`, and `adb` from any directory.
* Without it, you’d need to navigate to the `bin` folder manually every time.

### Configuring a Virtual Device

**Steps**:

1. Open **AVD Manager** in Android Studio
2. Click **Create Virtual Device**
3. Choose a device (e.g., Pixel)
4. Select a **system image** (x86\_64 + Google APIs)
5. Allocate **RAM and GPU** settings for performance
6. Finish setup and **launch emulator**

## 🎉 Completion Summary

You’ve mastered:

* Installing core components (Git, SDK, Android Studio)
