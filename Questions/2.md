## 💻 Dialogue Summary

### 🧑‍🏫 1. Xcode Installation & Configuration (Weight: 25%)

**Scenario**: Jamie downloads the Flutter SDK but skips Xcode.

**Why Xcode is essential**:

* Provides key tools: `git`, `simctl`, `xcrun`
* Enables iOS builds and simulator
* Required even when focusing on Android

**Commands Used**:

```bash
xcode-select --install
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

---

### 📦 2. Installing CocoaPods

**Why it's important**:

* Manages iOS plugin dependencies
* Required for `flutter run` on iOS

---

### ⚙️ 3. Android Studio Setup (Weight: 25%)

**Steps**:

* Install Android Studio
* Open **SDK Manager**, and install:

  * Android SDK
  * Platform-Tools
  * Build-Tools
  * Android Emulator
  * Latest Android API (e.g., API 33)

---

### 🧑‍💻 4. ZSH Configuration (Weight: 25%)

**Jamie edits `.zshrc`** to add Flutter to `PATH`.

**Command to apply changes**:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

> This loads new shell configuration instantly, enabling Flutter commands globally.

---

### 🩺 5. Flutter Doctor Validation

**Purpose**:
Checks the entire setup (Xcode, Android Studio, SDKs, paths, emulators, plugins).

**Common Fixes**:

* Missing Xcode tools → `xcode-select`
* Missing CocoaPods → `sudo gem install cocoapods`
* Missing PATH → update `.zshrc` and run `source ~/.zshrc`

---
